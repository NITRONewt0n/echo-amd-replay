An Echo Arena instant replay system similar to IgniteBot's NVIDIA Highlights implimentation, but for AMD

Uses python, pip, import keyboard, time, json
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen 
from urllib.error import URLError, HTTPError

To install, download amd-replay.py, python if you don't already have it, pip, and all necessary libraries listed above.

Once someone scores, it delays by 10 seconds, then fires CTRL + Shift + S (default AMD instant replay keybind). Lemme know if anything is brokey and I'll do my best to help! :)
